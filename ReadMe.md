# IoT 004 - PIR Motion Sensor

![IoT.004.gif](IoT.004.gif)

## Opinion

Im not a huge fan of the sensor in its current form as im getting a lot of false readings. 
Ill have to try it in a better environment to see if it works as intended however im also looking at a diffrent sensor that might be more reliable.


## Features

The project has the following features:
- Detects motion using a PIR sensor.
- Uses an ESP32 microcontroller for digital input and LED control.
- Lights up a red LED when motion is detected.
- Lights up a green LED when no motion is detected.
- (Optional) Resets the device after detecting motion.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Install the Arduino IDE and ESP32 board support.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
6. Open the serial monitor to view the motion detection status.
7. Observe the LEDs: the red LED lights up when motion is detected, and the green LED lights up when no motion is detected.

## Materials

The project requires the following materials:
- ESP32 microcontroller board.
- One PIR motion sensor.
- Two LEDs (one green, one red).
- Two resistors.
- Breadboard.
- Jumper wires.
